# Improve Me

This is a self improvment app built to showcase my development skills.

## API

The backend is built with NodeJS, graphql-yoga, and uses MongoDB.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using NextJS (Typescript) and AntDesign.

## Status

Still very early on in development. Working on core features and building the API. There is currently not hosted demo for the project, but I hope to have one up and running by mid October.
